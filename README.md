alx-listing-app-03
This project is a continuation of the listing application, focusing on implementing the Booking Detail Page.

Milestone 4: Booking Detail Page Implementation
This milestone involves creating a fully functional Booking Detail Page that allows users to:

Enter contact information.

Provide payment details.

Review booking information.

Confirm the booking.

The page will be styled using Tailwind CSS and will be responsive for different screen sizes.

Initial Setup
The alx-listing-app-00 repository was duplicated and renamed to alx-listing-app-03.

Folder Structure and Initial Page Creation
The following folder structure has been established:

components/
└── booking/
    ├── BookingForm.tsx
    ├── OrderSummary.tsx
    └── CancellationPolicy.tsx
pages/
└── booking/
    └── index.tsx


The pages/booking/index.tsx file has been created with a basic layout, importing BookingForm, OrderSummary, and CancellationPolicy components, and passing initial booking details.

Booking Form Component Implementation
The components/booking/BookingForm.tsx file has been implemented.

It includes input fields for:

Contact Information (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number)

Payment Information (Card Number, Expiration Date, CVV)

Billing Address (Street Address, Apt/Suite, City, State, Zip Code, Country)

The form uses Tailwind CSS for responsive styling and an organized layout.

Order Summary Component Implementation
The components/booking/OrderSummary.tsx file has been implemented.

It displays:

Property name, a placeholder image, and a review score.

Stay details (start date, total nights).

A clear breakdown of fees, including booking fee, subtotal, and grand total.

The component dynamically calculates the grand total based on the bookingDetails passed to it.

Cancellation Policy and Ground Rules Component Implementation
The components/booking/CancellationPolicy.tsx file has been implemented.

It includes:

A cancellation policy notice detailing full and partial refund conditions.

A list of ground rules for guests, emphasizing respectful use of the property.

Troubleshooting Build Errors
Error: Cannot find module 'autoprefixer': This error indicates that autoprefixer is missing. To resolve it, stop the development server (Ctrl + C) and then install the necessary packages by running:

npm install -D autoprefixer postcss

After installation, restart the development server with npm run dev.

Error: It looks like you're trying to use tailwindcss directly as a PostCSS plugin: This error means the way Tailwind CSS connects with PostCSS needs an update. To fix this:

Stop the development server (Ctrl + C).

Install the new Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin:

npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss

Ensure you have a postcss.config.js file in the root of your project (create it if it doesn't exist) with the following content:

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};

After saving the file, restart the development server with npm run dev.

Persistent Tailwind CSS PostCSS Plugin Error (After previous fixes): If the error persists, it often indicates issues with Tailwind's configuration or cached files. To resolve this:

Verify tailwind.config.js:

Ensure a tailwind.config.js file exists in the root of your project and that its content array correctly points to your source files, including "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}".

Verify styles/globals.css:

Confirm that styles/globals.css contains @tailwind base;, @tailwind components;, and @tailwind utilities; at the very top of the file.

Clear Cache and Reinstall Dependencies (The "Big Reset"): This is the most effective solution for stubborn build errors.

Stop the development server (Ctrl + C).

Delete the node_modules folder: rm -rf node_modules

Delete the Next.js cache folder: rm -rf .next

Reinstall all dependencies: npm install

Restart the server: npm run dev

Project Push to GitHub
All changes, including the implementation of the BookingForm, OrderSummary, and CancellationPolicy components, as well as the postcss.config.js and tailwind.config.js updates, have been committed and pushed to the main branch of the alx-listing-app-03 repository.
